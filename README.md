# Portfolio-website
I have build a responsive Portfolio Website that will be displaying images, links and descriptions for my Resume, Projects and Blog.
This is my first portfolio project.

##Files Included
* index.html
* style.css in css folder
* utilities.css in css folder
* images required in the images folder
* app.js in js folder

##Description
I used a text editor VScode for my project. I created a index.html file for the basic code for the portfolio webpage and for styling and layout of the webpage I used css. Later on I used javaScript to make a mobile navigation menu and to make my website more responsive. Then I uploaded my website on google drive to have a sharable link of the website.
